# CSS Min, Max & Clamp

A project to play around with `CSS` Min, Max &amp; Clamp functions.

Max is used for the body and content padding and the content's width.

Clamp is used for font size.

So far I have not seen the need to use min.

Note that this project is a playground for me to try out these functions. It is not a tutorial.
