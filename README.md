# CSS Min, Max & Clamp

This is a project for me to play around with `CSS` **Min**, **Max** & **Clamp** functions.

**Max** is used for the body and content padding and the content's width. A min value is set, and grows as the screen expands.

**Clamp** is used for `font-size` to give an ideal size, and a max and min size when the screen size gets too big or small.

So far I have not found a use-case for the **Min** function.

*Note:* that this project is a playground for me to try out these functions. This is not a tutorial. But you may use this project for your own reference.
